          <h2 class="article-subtitle">Are we the right team for this project?</h2>

          <h3>Analysis</h3>

          <p>
            The diversity of our team is our strength. Being from different industries, countries, demographics, and personalities have given us different perspectives and lenses throughout the process. For example, Natasha and Joaquin are both avid readers, while Rong and Zhaoxing do not read as much. Having these different involvements and perspectives on books was important! A portion of the group were able to talk from personal experience, while the other helped balance any biases and provide other perspectives. Our avid readers, have an intimate idea of the opportunity and value to be provided to our user. From a skillset perspective, we have individuals on our team with the design and technological expertise to create a compelling MVP.
          </p>
