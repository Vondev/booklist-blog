          <h3>Background</h3>

          <p>Our four person team is an extremely diverse group of people with backgrounds from the United States, Mexico, China and Singapore. We all have a different native  tongue and our ideals are culturally, socially different. This may have typically been considered a challenge, but for us it meant a wide range of potential dots to connect.</p>


          <h3>The Effectual Cycle</h3>

          <p>Discussing the effectual cycle is important to expand on the group synergy and to understand why the group was efficient and ideal for this project. It all begins with the individuals as themselves and what personal resources they have. These resources are divided into three different categories: who the person is, what knowledge the person has and what individuals does the person know. With these individual resources, each one of the members of the team can achieve different things. Pooled together these resources, expertise and experiences give us a strong starting point for a team.</p>

          <p>
            To begin topic generation, we discussed our personal experiences and passions. (It also served as a great icebreaker and bonded us together quickly!)  We were very liberal with what went into our initial list. We divided the topics into the following categories:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Social</li>
            <li>Personal</li>
            <li>Academic</li>
            <li>Leisure</li>
            <li>Knowledge Empowerment</li>
            <li>Adulting</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            During the discussion, we each marked which ideas were relevant to us and would be interested in pursuing. It is imperative to note that at this point, we were not thinking of solutions or the end to the problem. Quite the contrary, we sought a topic that we could all work on passionately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our group is comprised of two graduate students and two undergraduate students. Since none of us are freshmen, we all had to find different solutions for housing outside of Cornell’s facilities (such as renting an apartment or even a house). In our discussion, we realized that finding information was particularly  a problem for those unable to physically visit the location. After some research, we were unable to find a centralized location for information for apartment renting in Ithaca. It seemed we had discovered a problem area that our whole group faced and was a common challenge for our peers, especially those who were new to the Cornell area. We chose to expand upon apartment renting in Ithaca and begin observing the market.
          </p>

          <h3>The First Pivot: Horizons</h3>
          <p>
            After a lecture on the Horizons, we understood that we were not creating a new solution or exploring new markets, rather we were expanding upon a service for an existing, core market. Our apartment shopping problem was situated in Horizon 1, and any solution we could consider would offer only incremental improvements. We wanted to stretch for Horizon 3, that would challenge us creatively and where a sustainable, scalable and durable solution is more likely to exist. In our next meeting, we revisited other topics that we connected with. One of these topics was: books. Because of the inherent broadness of the topic, we could have a Horizon three opportunity, and provide a new solution or  approach to a completely different market.

          <h3>Our Final Opportunity</h3>
          <p>
            Our final opportunity was first observed in a session of our course. It is typical of guest lecturers at an institution like Cornell to recommend books that have impacted them throughout their journey. When this is offered, the listener scrambles to jot it down in whatever is nearest - likely a notebook, phone note or post-it. This scenario may also be a peer mentioning a book in a conversation, a text referenced in a article being read, or suggested reading by a speaker at a conference. Our observed problem is that that currently there is not an effective way to record these recommendations in a centralized location.

          </p>

          <h3>Market Research & Storytelling</h3>

          <p>
            To further understand this opportunity we went back into the market. For this phase of market research we conducted interviews of peers regarding our concept. Storytelling is a crucial way to find out the underlying emotional and social ties to your problem space. Stories told in our interviews showed key differences in customer segments when it came to motivation and interest. The following were interesting takeaways from our interviews: 
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>People read and collect the information mainly based on their interests and academic requirements, and recommendations. Book recommendations are scattered in various places: notepads, phone screenshots, texts, e-notes, post-its, Amazon shopping cart, ect., which often lead of incomplete pieces of information.</li>
            <li>The importance of book recommendations and storage are heavily influenced by whether or not you are an avid reader or are a part of a culture that encourages book sharing. It appears that this space is far more relevant to the business professional / entrepreneurial space than it is to some undergraduates, for example.</li>
            <li>For some, recommendations given by respected peers or mentors are considered valuable and were cited as the reason a book was ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Sometimes recall is of little consequences/inconvenience (ex. they can always turn to somewhere else (Prof./BB) to track the information they need therefore, they are not feeling the urgent need of extra assistance) At times, it could result in an embarrassing run in with their boss when he asks about the book he recommended.</li>
            <li>When suggestions were offered to them, they were open to try new things in this field, but were not interested in an overtech or “social” experience. Maybe it just works as-is.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            After the first round of market research, there were two dominant (opposing) stances emerging within our group. When we discussed the concept further and the questions we asked during our individual interviews, it became clear that we had different interpretations and understandings regarding our problem space. Thus, our interviews and questions were colored differently. The objectives of our interviews were unclear and inconsistent. In addition, how the questions were phrased (remaining open-ended, conversational, not leading) heavily influenced the outcome of our results. Our next discussion benefited greatly by taking time to get on the same page and considering a protocol for any next rounds of user conversations.

            In the article Can you hear me now? Learning from customer stories. Regarding to storytelling in business, the author suggested we should “focus on the few we deem worthy of our attention. A business can apply a similar mix of attentiveness and judgment in listening to customer stories. But which stories deserve attention? Which should flow from the front line to other parts of the organization?” The storytelling experience we had as a group vividly explained the importance of being consistent on themes when conducting qualitative research as it’s essential when it comes to the analyzing stage.

          <h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>

          <p>
            User Segmentation was a key takeaway from our market research. Our broad segmentation of  “anyone who reads” needed to be more narrowly segmented. To begin, our ideal customer reads avidly and already lists reads.  This opportunity and concept resonates most with graduate students, post-graduates and young professionals. We have chosen this to be our strongest customer/target end-user market. We have identified our early adopters to be young professionals aged 25-35,  with a lean towards industries like: business, entrepreneurship, and technology. This persona has been selected carefully for our opportunity, as those in these areas tend to give value to constantly sharpening, experiencing, and expanding through reading. As reflected in some of our user storytelling, book and knowledge sharing is a part of industry culture.

            Though, those handing us the cash (our customers) would be B2B partners: publishers and authors. Also, anyone interested in advertising to our target audience.
