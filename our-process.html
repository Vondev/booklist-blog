          <h3>Background</h3>

          <p>Our four person team is an extremely diverse group of people with backgrounds from the United States, Mexico, China and Singapore. We all have a different native  tongue and our ideals are culturally, socially different. This may have typically been considered a challenge, but for us it meant a wide range of potential dots to connect.</p>


          <h3>The Effectual Cycle</h3>

          <p>Discussing the effectual cycle is important to expand on the group synergy and to understand why the group was efficient and ideal for this project. It all begins with the individuals as themselves and what personal resources they have. These resources are divided into three different categories: who the person is, what knowledge the person has and what individuals does the person know. With these individual resources, each one of the members of the team can achieve different things. Pooled together these resources, expertise and experiences give us a strong starting point for a team.</p>

          <p>
            To begin topic generation, we discussed our personal experiences and passions. (It also served as a great icebreaker and bonded us together quickly!)  We were very liberal with what went into our initial list. We divided the topics into the following categories:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Social</li>
            <li>Personal</li>
            <li>Academic</li>
            <li>Leisure</li>
            <li>Knowledge Empowerment</li>
            <li>Adulting</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            During the discussion, we each marked which ideas were relevant to us and would be interested in pursuing. It is imperative to note that at this point, we were not thinking of solutions or the end to the problem. Quite the contrary, we sought a topic that we could all work on passionately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our group is comprised of two graduate students and two undergraduate students. Since none of us are freshmen, we all had to find different solutions for housing outside of Cornell’s facilities (such as renting an apartment or even a house). In our discussion, we realized that finding information was particularly  a problem for those unable to physically visit the location. After some research, we were unable to find a centralized location for information for apartment renting in Ithaca. It seemed we had discovered a problem area that our whole group faced and was a common challenge for our peers, especially those who were new to the Cornell area. We chose to expand on <span div="bold">apartment renting in Ithaca</span> and begin observing the market.
          </p>

          <h3></h3>

          <p>
            We began with a blended approach to Market Research. We focused on the first two elements of the four step process of ethnography: “Observation, storytelling, long interviews and build-measure-learn-do”. Our hypothesis was that, since the current existing sites’ lack functional navigation and most available resources are scattered, a one-stop platform for apartment research information would be received well. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Scouring many user submitted Q&A’s, concerns and responses/advice regarding apartment searching we were able to code and distill to seven major concerns:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Location Information: “Best” Neighborhood, Social (How does this relate to class status? Grad vs. UG is a major concern)</li>
            <li>Price: Average, rip-off concerns</li>
            <li>Process: Leasing, Financial Aid</li>
            <li>When to look: Seasons, deadlines, availability, urgency</li>
            <li>Distance from campus: Walkability, need for car, TCAT</li>
            <li>Property Management / Landlords: What’s available, who to trust</li>
            <li>Roommates: Should I get one and how</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The following are current options recommended to those beginning their search:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Craigslist</li>
            <li>IthacaRents.com</li>
            <li>Landlords' offices/websites</li>
            <li>Facebook Page (Cornell University Housing, Sublets & Roommates)</li>
            <li>RentCollegePads.com</li>
            <li>Recommendations from students</li>
            <li>Advertisements</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            After taking down and comparing online comments on the existing apartment rental websites, customers’ opinion on platform like Reddit, we have finished the first round of validation. There is certainly space for us to make improvement on apartment rental. The fact that each site not just presented information differently, but different information altogether, suggests that we were right about the lack of consistency and centralization. The barrage of housing questions (e.g. posts titled “how do you find housing off-campus?”) on these forums further confirms that finding housing information in Ithaca is  a problem for many students. In addition, current options neglect that this problem is more complex than a simple search process, it’s also related to the connected groups’ identities, their specific life contexts and many surrounding details (timing, gender, personal preference), the best solution would engage these things

         <h3>The First Pivot: Horizons</h3>
         <p>
          After a lecture on the Horizons, we understood that we were not creating a new solution or exploring new markets, rather we were expanding upon a service for an existing, core market. Our apartment shopping problem was situated in Horizon 1, and any solution we could consider would offer only incremental improvements. We wanted to stretch for Horizon 3, that would challenge us creatively and where a sustainable, scalable and durable solution is more likely to exist. In our next meeting, we revisited other topics that we connected with. One of these topics was: books. Because of the inherent broadness of the topic, we could have a Horizon three opportunity, and provide a new solution or  approach to a completely different market.
