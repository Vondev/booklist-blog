          <h1>Our Solution : Booklist</h1>
          <h2 class="article-subtitle">An in-depth analysis of this opportunity.</h2>

          <div class="spacer"></div>



          <h3>Our Final Opportunity</h3>
          <p>
            Our final opportunity was first observed in a session of our course. It is typical of guest lecturers at an institution like Cornell to recommend books that have impacted them throughout their journey. When this is offered, the listener scrambles to jot it down in whatever is nearest - likely a notebook, phone note or post-it. This scenario may also be a peer mentioning a book in a conversation, a text referenced in a article being read, or suggested reading by a speaker at a conference. Our observed problem is that that currently there is not an effective way to record these recommendations in a centralized location.

          </p>

          <h3>Market Research & Storytelling</h3>

          <p>
            To further understand this opportunity we went back into the market. For this phase of market research we conducted interviews of peers regarding our concept. Storytelling is a crucial way to find out the underlying emotional and social ties to your problem space. Stories told in our interviews showed key differences in customer segments when it came to motivation and interest. The following were interesting takeaways from our interviews: 
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>People read and collect the information mainly based on their interests and academic requirements, and recommendations. Book recommendations are scattered in various places: notepads, phone screenshots, texts, e-notes, post-its, Amazon shopping cart, ect., which often lead of incomplete pieces of information.</li>
            <li>The importance of book recommendations and storage are heavily influenced by whether or not you are an avid reader or are a part of a culture that encourages book sharing. It appears that this space is far more relevant to the business professional / entrepreneurial space than it is to some undergraduates, for example.</li>
            <li>For some, recommendations given by respected peers or mentors are considered valuable and were cited as the reason a book was ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Sometimes recall is of little consequences/inconvenience (ex. they can always turn to somewhere else (Prof./BB) to track the information they need therefore, they are not feeling the urgent need of extra assistance) At times, it could result in an embarrassing run in with their boss when he asks about the book he recommended.</li>
            <li>When suggestions were offered to them, they were open to try new things in this field, but were not interested in an overtech or “social” experience. Maybe it just works as-is.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            After the first round of market research, there were two dominant (opposing) stances emerging within our group. When we discussed the concept further and the questions we asked during our individual interviews, it became clear that we had different interpretations and understandings regarding our problem space. Thus, our interviews and questions were colored differently. The objectives of our interviews were unclear and inconsistent. In addition, how the questions were phrased (remaining open-ended, conversational, not leading) heavily influenced the outcome of our results. Our next discussion benefited greatly by taking time to get on the same page and considering a protocol for any next rounds of user conversations.

          <p>
            In the article "Can you hear me now? Learning from customer stories", in regards to storytelling in business, the author suggested we should “focus on the few we deem worthy of our attention. A business can apply a similar mix of attentiveness and judgment in listening to customer stories. But which stories deserve attention? Which should flow from the front line to other parts of the organization?” The storytelling experience we had as a group vividly explained the importance of being consistent on themes when conducting qualitative research as it’s essential when it comes to the analyzing stage.

          <h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>

          <p>
            User Segmentation was a key takeaway from our market research. Our broad segmentation of  “anyone who reads” needed to be more narrowly segmented. To begin, our ideal customer reads avidly and already lists reads.  This opportunity and concept resonates most with graduate students, post-graduates and young professionals. We have chosen this to be our strongest customer/target end-user market. We have identified our early adopters to be young professionals aged 25-35,  with a lean towards industries like: business, entrepreneurship, and technology. This persona has been selected carefully for our opportunity, as those in these areas tend to give value to constantly sharpening, experiencing, and expanding through reading. As reflected in some of our user storytelling, book and knowledge sharing is a part of industry culture.

            Though, those handing us the cash (our customers) would be B2B partners: publishers and authors. Also, anyone interested in advertising to our target audience.

          <h3>Interview Findings</h3>

          <p>
            Through our in-person interviews, we consolidated the top three problems our participants faced when trying to record down a book encountered in real life.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Capturing<br>
              The capturing of book names through current methods is typically scattered and haphazard. E.g. for a typical reader, some book names may be captured on a smartphone notes app, some scribbled on paper, and others captured as a photo or screenshot.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Storing<br>
              The stored book names are of different formats depending on how they are captured, and they are not in a centralized location. They also contain different tidbits of information: a typical record could have one or a combination of the book’s name, author, rough description, what the book is about, and so on. To keep them centralized, one has to go back at a later point in time to manually do bookkeeping.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Recalling<br>
              Because the records are typically scattered, it is difficult to recall what they are or even where they are. It is easy for the user to forget these records unless he or she remembers taking them.
            </li>
          </ol>




          <h3>Description of Solution</h3>

          <p>
            Our unique value proposition is summed up in our marketing statement: “Never miss a must read again. BookList captures quickly/easily and collects titles found out in your everyday life and lists them in a centralized location organized into your own customizable book lists.”
          </p>

          <p>
            These features are designed by directly addressing the top 3 problems identified above.
          </p>


          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Capture</p>
              <p>
                The Capture feature of Booklist focuses on fast and effortless capturing. It aims to emulate the ease of typing something into the notes app, which we found was the main way our interviewees recorded book recommendations into their phones. It features a freeform note-taking interface where the user can type anything they want (such as a half-formed book name, author name, or a description of the book). After the user finishes typing, the smart text parser will “read” what the user wrote and retrieve the actual book entry from the database. The entry will be automatically added to the user’s collection in the background.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from text, the interface also allows the user quickly select another mode of capturing, such as using the phone camera to scan a book’s cover or bar code, or searching for a book using voice search.
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <p>Capture</p>

            <li>
              <p>Recall</p>
              <p>
                The “Your Collection” feature of Booklist directly addresses the problem of recalling books. Here, the user’s collection of books will be in the form of a visual library, with book covers and book names automatically filled in, as opposed to disorganized scribbles. This collection is then searchable and sortable. Hence, the collection is an organized library of books that directly reflect the scribbles found in Capture notepad. The goal is to make bookkeeping automated and organized, hence making recalling a breeze.
              </p>
            </li>
            
          </ol>
