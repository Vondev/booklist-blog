          <h1>Our Solution : Booklist</h1>
          <h2 class="article-subtitle">An in-depth analysis of this opportunity.</h2>

          <div class="spacer"></div>



          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Our final opportunity was first observed in a session of our course. It is typical of guest lecturers at an institution like Cornell to recommend books that have impacted them throughout their journey. When this is offered, the listener scrambles to jot it down in whatever is nearest - likely a notebook, phone note or post-it. This scenario may also be a peer mentioning a book in a conversation, a text referenced in a article being read, or suggested reading by a speaker at a conference. Our observed problem is that that currently there is not an effective way to record these recommendations in a centralized location.

          </p>

          <h3>Market Research & Storytelling</h3>

          <p>
            To further understand this opportunity we went back into the market. For this phase of market research we conducted interviews of peers regarding our concept. Storytelling is a crucial way to find out the underlying emotional and social ties to your problem space. Stories told in our interviews showed key differences in customer segments when it came to motivation and interest. The following were interesting takeaways from our interviews: 
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>People read and collect the information mainly based on their interests and academic requirements, and recommendations. Book recommendations are scattered in various places: notepads, phone screenshots, texts, e-notes, post-its, Amazon shopping cart, ect., which often lead of incomplete pieces of information.</li>
            <li>The importance of book recommendations and storage are heavily influenced by whether or not you are an avid reader or are a part of a culture that encourages book sharing. It appears that this space is far more relevant to the business professional / entrepreneurial space than it is to some undergraduates, for example.</li>
            <li>For some, recommendations given by respected peers or mentors are considered valuable and were cited as the reason a book was ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Sometimes recall is of little consequences/inconvenience (ex. they can always turn to somewhere else (Prof./BB) to track the information they need therefore, they are not feeling the urgent need of extra assistance) At times, it could result in an embarrassing run in with their boss when he asks about the book he recommended.</li>
            <li>When suggestions were offered to them, they were open to try new things in this field, but were not interested in an overtech or “social” experience. Maybe it just works as-is.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            After the first round of market research, there were two dominant (opposing) stances emerging within our group. When we discussed the concept further and the questions we asked during our individual interviews, it became clear that we had different interpretations and understandings regarding our problem space. Thus, our interviews and questions were colored differently. The objectives of our interviews were unclear and inconsistent. In addition, how the questions were phrased (remaining open-ended, conversational, not leading) heavily influenced the outcome of our results. Our next discussion benefited greatly by taking time to get on the same page and considering a protocol for any next rounds of user conversations.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the article "Can you hear me now? Learning from customer stories", in regards to storytelling in business, the author suggested we should “focus on the few we deem worthy of our attention. A business can apply a similar mix of attentiveness and judgment in listening to customer stories. But which stories deserve attention? Which should flow from the front line to other parts of the organization?” The storytelling experience we had as a group vividly explained the importance of being consistent on themes when conducting qualitative research as it’s essential when it comes to the analyzing stage.

          </p>

          <h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>

          <p>
            User Segmentation was a key takeaway from our market research. Our broad segmentation of  “anyone who reads” needed to be more narrowly segmented. To begin, our ideal customer reads avidly and already lists reads.  This opportunity and concept resonates most with graduate students, post-graduates and young professionals. We have chosen this to be our strongest customer/target end-user market. We have identified our early adopters to be young professionals aged 25-35,  with a lean towards industries like: business, entrepreneurship, and technology. This persona has been selected carefully for our opportunity, as those in these areas tend to give value to constantly sharpening, experiencing, and expanding through reading. As reflected in some of our user storytelling, book and knowledge sharing is a part of industry culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though, those handing us the cash (our customers) would be B2B partners: publishers and authors. Also, anyone interested in advertising to our target audience.
          </p>


          <h3>Interview Findings</h3>

          <p>
            Through our in-person interviews, we consolidated the top three problems our participants faced when trying to record down a book encountered in real life.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p class="bold">Capturing</p>
              The capturing of book names through current methods is typically scattered and haphazard. E.g. for a typical reader, some book names may be captured on a smartphone notes app, some scribbled on paper, and others captured as a photo or screenshot.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <p class="bold">Storing</p>
              The stored book names are of different formats depending on how they are captured, and they are not in a centralized location. They also contain different tidbits of information: a typical record could have one or a combination of the book’s name, author, rough description, what the book is about, and so on. To keep them centralized, one has to go back at a later point in time to manually do bookkeeping.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <p class="bold">Recalling</p>
              Because the records are typically scattered, it is difficult to recall what they are or even where they are. It is easy for the user to forget these records unless he or she remembers taking them.
            </li>
          </ol>




          <h3>Description of Solution</h3>

          <p>
            Our unique value proposition is summed up in our marketing statement: “Never miss a must read again. BookList captures quickly/easily and collects titles found out in your everyday life and lists them in a centralized location organized into your own customizable book lists.”
          </p>

          <p>
            These features are designed by directly addressing the top 3 problems identified above.
          </p>


          <ol>
            <li>
              <p class="bold">Capture</p>
              <p>
                The Capture feature of Booklist focuses on fast and effortless capturing. It aims to emulate the ease of typing something into the notes app, which we found was the main way our interviewees recorded book recommendations into their phones. It features a freeform note-taking interface where the user can type anything they want (such as a half-formed book name, author name, or a description of the book). After the user finishes typing, the smart text parser will “read” what the user wrote and retrieve the actual book entry from the database. The entry will be automatically added to the user’s collection in the background.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from text, the interface also allows the user quickly select another mode of capturing, such as using the phone camera to scan a book’s cover or bar code, or searching for a book using voice search.
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <p class="bold">Storage</p>
              <p>

            <li>
              <p class="bold">Recall</p>
              <p>
                The “Your Collection” feature of Booklist directly addresses the problem of recalling books. Here, the user’s collection of books will be in the form of a visual library, with book covers and book names automatically filled in, as opposed to disorganized scribbles. This collection is then searchable and sortable. Hence, the collection is an organized library of books that directly reflect the scribbles found in Capture notepad. The goal is to make bookkeeping automated and organized, hence making recalling a breeze.

          <h3>Our Unique Value &mdash; V.S. Competitors</h3>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <h5>Primary competitors</h5>

          <p>
            Though there are  few direct competitors for our concept, our strongest competitor is Goodreads, An Amazon owned website. Amazon’s authority in the space gives it an inherent advantage. Goodreads refers to itself as a “social cataloguing” website, allowing users to organize their reading lists while sharing with a community.  
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to Goodreads, there are a few other smaller applications such as Libib and Litsy. Like the Amazon subsidiary, these applications appear to focus on different demographics and features.
          </p>

          <h5>Secondary competitors</h5>
          <p>
           The Book and Reference space is largely comprised of applications for e-books and retail, Kindle, Apple Books, and Amazon are a few examples. We do not intend to include retail or to compete directly with these applications, but they are often used as current solutions for the problem we intend on tackling, so worth noting.
         </p>


         <p>
          Though we don’t have an unfair advantage, we intend on differentiating our product for both our customers and end-users in the following ways: 
        </p>


        <h5>Customer segmentation</h5>
        <p>
          Our solution focuses on professional, academic, and entrepreneurial readers. It was expressed in market research that the social element of competitors was distracting and irrelevant. In addition, competitors focus on more classic literature and the priorities of those genres’ readers. Our concept’s main value is the quick capture and customizable listing of books, ensuring you never miss nothing and remembering a read. Further, any recommendations by influential people such as entrepreneurs, professors, scholars and respected peers. 
        </p>

        <h5>Quality and user experience</h5>

        <p>
          Current options are archaic and are lacking in strong design. The dated nature of libraries and books have been transitioned awkwardly into the digital space. For our target, a facelift would be necessary. Particularly our early adopters have high expectations for UX/UI that have not been met in book reference and recommendation websites and applications. Much of the value of our product will be it’s ease of use and seamless integration into everyday life.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe this customer prioritization and a focus on user experience will have strong value for our end-user. Because of this, adoption and retention for our key market will exceed current alternatives, adding more eyes on advertisements, therefore value, for our customers.
        </p>

        <h3>Channels</h3>

        <p>
          In order to get the value proposition into the hands of our customers there will outbound channels and inbound channels. Outbound channels are ways to reach out into the market to find potential customers and inbound channels are scalable and important to bring customers to our solution. Outbound channels utilized will be product reviews from the application store, the Facebook comment page, and a “Contact Us” tab to allow the customer to give recommendations of what they want to see in the future. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of inbound channels, we will be utilizing a marketing team to create targeted advertisements that will appear on different websites. Sponsorships with podcasts will be another inbound to increase exposure. These channels will scale as the business grows, until we reach a critical mass of people utilizing the application. 
        </p>

        <h3>Financial Assessment of Opportunity </h3>

        <p>
          Our metric for success is <span class="bold">active users</span>. As we are starting out, we believe 100 new users a month would define success for our product. Though, we will explain later what it would take to be profitable.
        </p>


        <h5>Expected costs</h5>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">Fixed Costs</span> (Registration for software, Equipment, website, other costs) with a total of an estimated $7,300 for a medium scope mobile application for a single operating system.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">Variable Costs</span> (servers, labor, IT support, marketing) start at $13,000 (at the very minimum; a more realistic estimate will be about $25,000) and grows linearly depending on the number of simultaneous users. IT support will increase slightly.
        </p>

        <p>
          An assumption of active <span class="bold">100,000</span> users in an application with only 90% of users not deleting the application has the potential of 90,000 users. Assuming only 80% have an internet connection, the total goes down to 72,000. An impression counts as an advertisement that plays for 30 seconds as a “normal” metric. There can be a maximum of 2 impressions per minute; furthermore, 72,000*5=360,000 minutes. 360,000*2=720,000 impressions. The effective cost per thousand impressions is the total earnings/Total (impressions*1000). So if 1,000 ads were shown and it nets a $200 in revenue, the expected revenue is 720,000/1000=720*2=1,440 of expected revenue per 1,000 impressions. Or $1.44 per impression. Assuming fixed costs of about $23,000, <span class="bold">there needs to be 1,5972 impressions or a little bit less than 8,000 active users.</span> Aiming for 8,000 active users and then scaling up is a fair estimate for the beginning of the development of the app.

        </p>

        <p>
          We believe that this is more than attainable based on the market opportunity. According to a Pew research study our target audience is very likely to have read a book from start to finish in the last 12 months (80% of 18-49 yr olds and 92% of college graduates reported that the had in 2017). The last US Census reports that there are 67,446,100 aged within our segment. With 89% of US adults (25 yrs and older) holding a degree, we can be certain at least 35,000,000 US adults would be situated in our target (25-35, college graduates). Though we cannot assume that the 92% who have reported themselves as readers would fall into our more narrow avid reader category, if we say that 50% of that number is, therefore may be interested in our concept our or market size sits comfortably at <span>17 million</span>.

        <h5>Our Landing Page Experiment</h5>
        <p>
          To gage public interest in our product, we put together a landing page describing the problem and how <span class="italic">Booklist</span> would solve it. <a class="anchor-link" href="https://vondev.github.io/booklist/" target="_blank">Click here to view it.</a>
        </p>

        </div>

        <h5>Survey</h5>
        <p>
          We chose to ask five questions as well as the possibility to leave the email because we value people’s time and we want to make it as short as possible, while gathering all the available data that we can assume is thruthfull. The first question after our short explanation is a very simple metric to gauge interest. People who are answering the survey already went through the landing page and read what our concept is. They clicked on more information and the will want to answer the survey as they had to take many steps to get there.
        </p>


        <h3>
          Overall Assessment
        </h3>

        <p>
          After going through the Lean Canvas Tool, we believe that we have discovered an interesting opportunity with a sizeable market. Our phases into the market have validated that there are pain points, interest, and a potential target customer. Though, it would take additional time with this market to validate if this is a viable, profitable product. Our next phase would be to launch our landing page to gather more data on the size of the target market. There is a clear difference from people who are interested in the idea and people who would actively use the application. We concluded that using downloads as a key metric will not suffice as our profit model includes advertisement; furthermore, having active users is the primary focus at this stage. The landing page is a good start as a formulation of an experiment; nevertheless, going through and both sizing the market (in terms of interest) as well as having a better idea of how the application would be used will be crucial to have an accurate assessment of the opportunity.
